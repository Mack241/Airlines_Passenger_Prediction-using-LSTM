# Airlines_Passenger_Prediction-using-LSTM
This Deep Learning Model uses the LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) network to process time-stamp prediction for the number of passengers in an airline
The look-back variable looks back at 5 time steps before the initiation of the prediciton.
epochs is set to 5000
batch_size is set to 50 #for faster iterations
The entire dataset is divided into test and train datasets.
The train dataset is 73% of the entire data set and the remaining 27% is the test dataset.
